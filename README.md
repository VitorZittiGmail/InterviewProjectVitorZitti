Here is my project to be reviewed by ExSquared LATAM.

It`s a basic List App, made with SwiftUI, with a Details page, the API used is the [Cataas, Cat as a service](http://cataas.com).

The app has 2 Views, the CatListView and the CatDetailsView.

The CatListView, lists the cats from the Api response, clicking in a Cat Photo will open the Details Page, since the Api does not return information about the Cat, a Placeholder text is used.
